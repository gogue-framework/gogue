# Gogue - Roguelike toolkit for Go

Gogue aims to create a simple to use toolkit for creating Roguelike games in the Go language. It uses BearLibTerminal for rendering, so that will be required to use the toolkit.
I'm basing the API heavily off of LibTCOD's API, as I feel that is an excellent library, in terms of what functionality a toolkit like this should offer.

Development is on-going, so use at your own risk.

## Getting Started

Standard Go package install - `go get github.com/jcerise/gogue`

### Prerequisites

BearLibTerminal is required to use this package. I'll put specific platform install instructions here, as it varies from platform to platform, and is not well documented (I feel).
